## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete these exercises on my own, the exercises were very helpful especially when it came to completing homework 1. The slides were also super helpful when something was not clear.

### Accessibility

I was able to complete this assignment mostly by myself. I did get help with it during class from my classmates and the professor. Overall the lab exercise was pretty clear I did watch the videos to see if I was doing it right and there were some stuff that I used from that video towards my assignment.

### CSS

I watched some of the videos to complete some of the lab exercises. I really had a hard time with the media query exercise and even after watching the video my results weren't 100 percent accurate.
These assignments were helpful when it came to homework 2.
