## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete these exercises on my own, the exercises were very helpful especially when it came to completing homework 1. The slides were also super helpful when something was not clear.

### Accessibility

I was able to complete this assignment mostly by myself. I did get help with it during class from my classmates and the professor when we had the chance to work on it in class. Overall the lab exercise was pretty clear I did watch the videos to see if I was doing it right and there were some stuff that I used from that video towards my assignment.

### CSS

I watched some of the videos to complete some of the lab exercises. I really had a hard time with the media query exercise and even after watching the video my results weren't 100 percent accurate.
These assignments were helpful when it came to homework 2.

### Flexbox

For this section of the lab notebook I was able to complete almost all of it on my own but I did use the video for container 5. All of them were helpful to learn about using flexbox. I wished that it was explained that we had to add a little bit of code so that the initial display was the purple boxes, I did have to use the video to get started.

### CSS Grid

For this exercise I was able to complete all of them except for container 4, I did use the video for the right answers. This exercise was very helpful when it came to learning CSS grid.

## Bootstrap

For this exercise I had to use the videos to try and complete the exercises. In general Bootstrap was probably the topic that confused me and I am not sure why. Finishing these lab assignments would've been helpful for homework 3.

## Javascript

I had to watch some videos to learn how to complete the assignment especially for the fetch assignment. I was having a hard time creating a api reader function without using async. This assignment was helpful when it came to finishing homework 3.
